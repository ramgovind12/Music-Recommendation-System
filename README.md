## Overview

Welcome to the Music Recommendation System project! This system is designed to provide you with personalized music recommendations using collaborative filtering. If you're a music enthusiast, this is the perfect tool to discover new songs that match your taste.

## Algorithm

We employ collaborative filtering, a popular recommendation algorithm, to suggest songs. Collaborative filtering analyzes user behavior, such as song plays and likes, to identify patterns and recommend songs that other users with similar tastes have enjoyed. This algorithm is effective in providing personalized recommendations.

## Dataset

Our recommendation system is powered by the Spotify Dataset. This rich dataset includes a vast collection of songs, artist information, and user interactions. By leveraging this data, we can offer recommendations that align with your musical preferences.

## Tech Stack

- Python: The core programming language used to build the recommendation system.
- Streamlit: A user-friendly web app framework for creating interactive and visually appealing interfaces.
- Pandas: Data manipulation library for handling and processing datasets.
- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library used for implementing collaborative filtering.
- GitHub: The platform hosting this project's repository and codebase.
